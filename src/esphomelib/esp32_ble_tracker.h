/** The ESP32BLETracker class is a hub for all ESP32 Bluetooth Low Energy devices.
 *
 * This implementation is currently only quite basic and only supports using scan to
 * see if BLE beacons can be found. In the future, this class will support exposing the RSSI
 * service data and some GATTC standardized information like temperature.
 *
 * The implementation uses a lightweight version of the amazing ESP32 BLE Arduino library by
 * Neil Kolban. This was done because the ble library was quite huge and esphomelib would only
 * ever use a small part of it anyway. Still though, when this component is used, the required
 * flash size increases by a lot (about 500kB). As the BLE stack uses humongous amounts of
 * stack size, this component creates a separate FreeRTOS task to handle all BLE stuff with
 * its own stack.
 *
 * Also, currently only BLE beacons seem to be picked up by this component. In the future I will
 * try to also make this work with standard BLE devices (like smartwatches, phones, ...), but that
 * will require a bit of reading up on the (very complicated) Bluetooth standard and might take a while.

class ESP32BLETracker : public Component {
 public:
  /** Create a simple binary sensor for a MAC address.
   *
   * Each time a BLE scan yields the MAC address in the address parameter, the binary sensor
   * will immediately go to true. When a whole scan interval does not discover a device with this
   * MAC address, the binary sensor will be set to false.
   *
   * The address parameter accepts a MAC address as an array of length 6 with each MAC address
   * part in an unsigned int. To set it up, do something like this:
   *
   * ```cpp
   * // MAC address AC:37:43:77:5F:4C
   * App.register_binary_sensor(tracker->make_device("ESP32 BLE Device", {
   *    0xAC, 0x37, 0x43, 0x77, 0x5F, 0x4C
   * }));
   * ```
   *
   * You can get this MAC address by navigating to the bluetooth screen of your device and looking for
   * an advanced settings screen, you can usually find the MAC address there. Alternatively, you can
   * set the global debug level to DEBUG and observe the logs. Then you will find messages like this:
   *
   * ```
   * Found device AC:37:43:77:5F:4C RSSI=-80
   *     Address Type: PUBLIC
   *     Name: 'Google Home Mini'
   * ```
   *
   * If the Address Type shown in the logs is "RANDOM", you unfortunately can't track that device at
   * the moment as the device constantly changes its MAC address as a "security" feature.
   *
   * @see set_scan_interval
   * @param name The name of the binary sensor to create.
   * @param address The MAC address to match.
   * @return

  /** Set the number of seconds (!) that a single BLE scan should take.
   *
   * This parameter is useful when adjusting how long it should take for a bluetooth device

   *
